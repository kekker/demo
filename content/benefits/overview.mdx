# Build and run blockchain applications even without any prior blockchain expertise

If you are an individual developer or a team of developers working on a decentralized app, this is for you

## Problem

Before starting to build a decentralized business app, a company needs to hire DLT expertise, setup DLT infrastructure,
and develop a software layer on top of DLT to build business apps upon. **This typically takes from 10 months and costs
hundreds of thousands of dollars.**

## Solution

DLT expertise: not needed at all. Infrastructure: sandbox with the most popular blockchain infrastructures is set up.
Middleware with well documented APIs and Scenarios. **Start building your solution on day one.**
