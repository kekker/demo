# Build and run blockchain applications without any prior blockchain expertise

If you are an individual developer or a team of developers working on a decentralized app, this is for you

## Problem

Before starting to build a decentralized business app, a company needs to hire DLT expertise, setup DLT infrastructure, 
and develop a software layer on top of DLT to build business apps upon. **This typically takes from 10 months and costs 
hundreds of thousands of dollars.**

## Solution

DLT expertise: not needed at all. Infrastructure: sandbox with the most popular blockchain infrastructures is set up. 
Middleware with well documented APIs and Scenarios. **Start building your solution on day one.**

> With Kekker you save upfront: $170-220k and 7-9 months

***

We are the team that built and launched Europeâ€™s leading B2B blockchain platform with over $100 mln in monthly 
transactional turnover. We consulted organizations and individuals working on decentralized solutions for years before 
launching Kekker.

## Comparable economics


Kekker allows for 10X faster time-to-market than direct competition, is 100X cheaper/faster than hiring experts and is easy to setup and use and no DLT/DFS experience needed!  


Cut your time to market by 6 to 12 months and save hundreds of thousands of dollars in man-hours by focusing on building business applications, not the setup & maintenance of your DLT solution.
