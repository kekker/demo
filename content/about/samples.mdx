### Discover the power of Kekker Platform with several fully functional, real-world Kekker-based DApp examples.

A fully featured Trade Finance Dashboard designed with Kekker Deal on top of 3-node Ethereum network.

The Trade Finance Dapp is a real-life business application built on top of Kekker blockchain tools. 
It serves a dashboard to track the Letter of Credit (LC) issuance and all subsequent steps of LC lifecycle. 

In the Trade Finance Dapp UI one can pick a blockchain network to operate in. Dashboard allows the LC issuing on the 
one blockchain node (Bank) and performing changes across other nodes (Seller, Buyer). All data and corresponding 
API requests are tracked at the bottom of the screen. 

Trade Finance Dapp is an ideal example of how to connect business application features and Kekker blockchain capabilities. 
The app uses Kekker API to transfer the business application commands to blockchain. To do this, a business application 
should operate with “Abstract business object” logic. Learn more

Access the source code with the best practices of Kekker development and use this as a starting point for your next 
great cross-platform application.
