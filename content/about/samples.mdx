### Discover the power of Kekker Platform with several fully functional, real-world Kekker-based DApp examples.

## Trade Finance Dashboard
Trade Finance Dashboard designed with Kekker Software and running on top of Kekker Sandbox.

The Trade Finance Dashboard tracks the Letter of Credit (LC) lifecycle steps. In the dashboard UI one selects a
preferred blockchain network, issues LC on the one blockchain node (Bank) and performs transactions across other nodes
(Seller, Buyer). All data and corresponding API requests are tracked at the bottom of the screen.

Trade Finance Dashboard app is an example of connecting business application features and Kekker blockchain capabilities.
The app uses Kekker APIs to transfer the business application commands to different blockchain protocols using
“Abstract Business Object” logic [learn more](/docs/getting-started/main-concepts.html).

Access the source code with the best practices of Kekker development (*to be available soon*) and use this as a starting
point for your cross-platform product.
