# File operations

The Kekker Platform Adapter assumes two modes of interaction with the Business Application:
* Sharing files via a shared local file system
* Sharing files using specific operations on the Kekker Platform API

In the first case, the Adapter and the Line-of-Business Application either share a common local file system, or their 
file systems can access each other. Therefore, files associated with business objects (for example, with a change in 
the Transaction state) are identified by their local path in the Adapter file system.

> **See API documentation: [API: File Requests](/docs/api/requests-files.html)**

When this is infeasible, the second case is used where the Business Application uses specific API operations to exchange files with the Adapter:
* `POST/api/files` - to send the file to the Adapter
* `GET /api/files/{uid}` - to get a file from the Adapter


In this case, the files in the Adapter API operations are identified by **a unique file identifier "fileUid"** generated by the Adapter when performing the `POST/api/files` operation, as well as when receiving files from other participantsâ€™ nodes.

When working with [Kekker Sandbox](/docs/getting-started/sandbox.html), use the specific operations on the Kekker Platform API. 
There is no connection between the user and the Sandbox local file systems. 

Therefore, for each file sent through the Adapter, the Business Application must perform a `POST/api/files` operation 
and use the resulting **fileUid** in all API operations associated with this file. 

To get the contents of files received by the Adapter from other nodes, the Line-of-Business Application must use 
the `GET /api/files/{uid}` operation, where the **fileUid** value will be sent by the Adapter with regards to the 
corresponding business object.
