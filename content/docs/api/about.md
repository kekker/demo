# About

Your business application will use APIs to interact with the Platform Node. The APIs are provided by the Platform 
Adapter, which converts operations with abstract business objects into operations with DLT and DFS components.
 
 
The whole set of operations provided by the Kekker Platform API can be divided into the following groups:
* [File operations](/docs/api/file-operations.html)
* [Operations with networks/clusters and member lists](/docs/api/operations-with-networks.html)
* [Interactions with operation queues](/docs/api/interaction-with-operation-queues.html)
* [Interactions with events](/docs/api/interaction-with-events.html)
* [Operations with abstract business objects](/docs/api/operations-with-abstract-business-objects.html)
