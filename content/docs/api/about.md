# About

Your app uses API to interact with the Platform Node. 
The Kekker Platform Adapter converts operations with Abstract Business Objects into operations with DLT and DFS components.
 
The Kekker API operations:
* [File operations](/docs/api/file-operations.html)
* [Operations with networks/clusters and member lists](/docs/api/operations-with-networks.html)
* [Interactions with operation queues](/docs/api/interaction-with-operation-queues.html)
* [Interactions with events](/docs/api/interaction-with-events.html)
* [Operations with abstract business objects](/docs/api/operations-with-abstract-business-objects.html)
