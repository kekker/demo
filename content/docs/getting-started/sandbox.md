# Sandbox

Kekker Sandbox is free and provides a unique opportunity to build a prototype or MVP on any of the popular blockchains. 
When you are ready to launch your business application or at any other moment you can move to your own infrastructure 
or use our commercial infrastructure hosting and supporting services.

#### The Sandbox consists of four separate clusters:
* Private Ethereum cluster
* Public Ethereum cluster
* Hyperledger Fabric cluster (limited free availability)
* Quorum cluster (limited free availability)

The clusters interact with each other via a dedicated trunk network.

#### Private Ethereum cluster contains 3 nodes:

* `democlient1.kekker.com`
* `democlient2.kekker.com`
* `democlient3.kekker.com`

#### Public Ethereum cluster is based on an Ethereum testnet Rinkeby contains 2 nodes:

* `pubdemoclient1.kekker.com`
* `pubdemoclient2.kekker.com`

#### Hyperledger Fabric cluster contains 2 nodes:

* `XXXXX.kekker.com`
* `XXXXX2.kekker.com`

#### Quorum cluster contains 2 nodes:
* `XXXXX.kekker.com`
* `XXXXX2.kekker.com`

### Sandbox Access
Hit the Sandbox Access button, fill out the form and get your access credentials in no time. 

### Differences from production environment
The Sandbox contains test data only and is completely separate from your production environment. 
The Sandbox API endpoints URLs clearly state ‘demo’ (e.g., https://democlient1.kekker.com/) 
unlike the production environment URLs (e.g., https://api.kekker.com/).

> Real commercial data should never be used in the Sandbox.

### Transaction timing in Private and Public Networks
Unlike Private Network transactions typically processed within a few minutes, 
transactions in Public Networks may require up to 30 minutes to process.

### Sandbox Benefits 

* **Increase productivity and Accelerate release cycles:** 
   
   No more waiting for a decentralized environment to set up and scale. 
Start building your product instantaneously with the DLT/DFS infrastructure you need, 
helping dev and QA teams increase their efficiency. 

   Use Scenarios and well documented API resources to quickly and efficiently speed up the entire development process.

* **Scale as needed or move to a blockchain infrastructure tailored to your needs:** 
   
   Multi-blockchain environment makes it simple to scale your products up or down as you need them or even move your product to a different blockchain infrastructure.

* **Enhance quality and Control spending:** 
   
   Avoid DLT/DFS environment configuration drift, so you can produce higher-quality releases. Easily replicate your Sandbox environment to the production stage, eliminating hardware and cloud sprawl.

* **Save time and money:** 
   
   Save hundreds of thousands of dollars in man-hours and cut your time-to-market by 6 to 12 months 
   by focusing on building your business application, not the setup and maintenance of your decentralized infrastructure.
