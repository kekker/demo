# Get started

We have prepared some use cases for you to try out the Kekker Platform.

Each case contains a business description and a script consisting of a sequence API calls. You can execute scripts in the command line or terminal. 

Cases are presented in order of increasing complexity and each subsequent case demonstrates platform's new features. You are free to use any script as is or to change it as per your requirements. You can also create your own transition map as per your business process.
